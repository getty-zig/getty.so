# Announcing Getty 0.4.0

<!-- more -->

I am happy to announce a new version of Getty, 0.4.0. :tada:

Getty is a framework for building __robust__, __optimal__, and __reusable__
serializers/deserializers in Zig. To install Getty, follow the instructions
listed on the [Installation](https://getty.so/user-guide/installation/) page.

## What's in 0.4.0

Despite [0.3.0](https://getty.so/blog/announcing-getty-030/) coming out less
than a month ago, we already have a new major version! Apparently, living at
the `HEAD` of Zig is quite an unstable life. Who would've thunk!

This release contains bug fixes, adds support for a handful of new types, and
introduces a few breaking changes to the API and build process (the Zig package manager is alive!).

### Allocators for SBs &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation:{ .breaking-change title="Breaking Change" }

The [`getty.serialize`](https://docs.getty.so/#A;getty:serialize) function and
the `serialize` function in SBs now take an optional allocator as a parameter.

This change allows SBs to allocate memory on the heap should they need to
before they hand off serialization to a serializer. One example of where this
change can be useful is the SB for
[`std.SemanticVersion`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#A;std:SemanticVersion),
which dynamically allocates space whenever formatting a version number since
they can be arbitrarily long.

### Packaging Getty &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation:{ .breaking-change title="Breaking Change" }

Zig's new package manager is now capable of adding Getty to your projects!

The [Installation](https://getty.so/user-guide/installation/) page has been
updated to reflect this and walks you through the new steps. The old, manual
way of installing Getty will not work anymore, so be sure to update your
`build.zig` (and `build.zig.zon`) accordingly! 

Support for Gyro and Zigmod has been removed. All hail the Zig package manager!

### Fixes

- The `rename` attribute has been fixed so that it no longer acts as an alias. ([a52ec21](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/commit/a52ec214306b8611eb88c28ef4f30c6862377896))
- DBs now return `error.MissingAllocator` when allocation is required but no allocator is present. Before, they would simply panic after attempting to unwrap a `null` allocator. ([644cfc5](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/commit/644cfc5ae1c0a1ad56be546d42d0a9dc3d818793))
- The `blocks` namespaces no longer group similar types together under a single declaration. That is, `blocks.ArrayList` and `blocks.ArrayListAligned` are now separate declaration. ([5e366ca](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/commit/5e366ca9128d4aa8e2c5826e7c7e2065f1e0bb70))
- The test deserializer now properly checks the length of sequence tokens. ([0ca32de](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/commit/0ca32de0c169fe16a3de3e58f49bb6b33eeea7c3))
- Serialization examples now use the `getty.ser.Error` error set. ([bba74b7](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/commit/bba74b78167edf6167a1a664674a39f6ea49c7d9))
- `README` links and badges have been fixed. ([94231c2](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/commit/94231c2c061794b57fc495c15da3aa3722cd1e64))
