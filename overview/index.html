<p>Getty is a framework for building serializers and deserializers in Zig.</p>

<p>Usually, (de)serializers written in Zig are just functions that take a value, switch on its type, and (de)serialize based on the resulting type information. In fact, this is exactly what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std.json</code> does! Unfortunately, the problem with this approach is that it is very brittle, inflexible, and ends up being a lot of unnecessary work.</p>

<p>The goal of Getty is to help you avoid all of that and reduce the amount of code you need to write a (de)serializer that is customizable, performant, and able to support a wide variety of data types out of the box. Additionally, Getty is data format-agnostic, meaning that you can make a (de)serialier for any data format out there so long as you’re able to map from the data format to Getty’s data models.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>At a high-level, Getty consists of two flows: a <strong>serialization flow</strong> and a <strong>deserialization flow</strong>.</p>

<p>In the serialization flow, a Zig value is passed to Getty and, based on its type, a <a href="/blocks-and-tuples">Serialization Block</a> is selected and executed by Getty, serializing the passed-in value into Getty’s serialization <a href="/data-models">data model</a>. The resulting Getty value is then passed to a serializer, which serializes it into an output data format.</p>

<p>In the deserialization flow, a Zig type is passed to Getty and, based on the type, a <a href="/blocks-and-tuples">Deserialization Block</a> is selected and executed by Getty, prompting a deserializer to deserialize its input data into Getty’s deserialization <a href="/data-models">data model</a>. The resulting Getty value is then passed to a Visitor, where it is converted into a Zig value of the initial type.</p>
