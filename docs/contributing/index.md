This page provides some information and a few guidelines to help get you started on your contributing journey. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on the [Getty Discord](https://discord.gg/njDA67U5ph).

## Zig

- Getty currently tracks the [`master` release of Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/), so make sure your version is updated.

## Issues

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/issues) are used exclusively for tracking bugs and feature requests for Getty.

- When filing an issue, please provide a brief explanation on how to reproduce your issue.

- When filing a feature request, please check if the latest version of Getty already implements the feature beforehand and whether there's already an issue filed for your feature.

## Pull Requests

- Please follow our [Style Guide](/contributing/style-guide) whenever contributing code.

- Before submitting a PR, please test your changes and ensure that the test suite passes locally.

- When submitting a PR, please have it be relative to a recent Git tip.

- If you push a new version of a PR, please add a comment about the new version. Notifications aren't sent for commits, so it's easy to miss updates without an explicit comment.
