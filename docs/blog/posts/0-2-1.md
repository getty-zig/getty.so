# Announcing Getty 0.2.1

<!-- more -->

A new point release of Getty has been published, 0.2.1.

Getty is a framework for building __robust__, __optimal__, and __reusable__
serializers/deserializers in Zig. To install Getty for your project, follow the
instructions listed on the
[Installation](https://getty.so/user-guide/installation/) page.

## What's in 0.2.1

Getty 0.2.1 is a minor update that is designed to prepare
the project for the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
workflow. The release batches together some improvements and fixes to make the transition easier.

- Serialization and deserialization support for [`std.BufMap`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root;BufMap) has been added.

- `examples/build.zig` has been fixed, so now the examples successfully compile and run.
