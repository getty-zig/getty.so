# Announcing Getty 0.2.2

<!-- more -->

A new point release of Getty has been published, 0.2.2.

Getty is a framework for building __robust__, __optimal__, and __reusable__
serializers/deserializers in Zig. To install Getty, follow the instructions
listed on the [Installation](https://getty.so/user-guide/installation/) page.

## What's in 0.2.2

Getty 0.2.2 addresses a few issues caused by changes in the standard library and [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

- To reference a field's type, the standard library switched to `type` instead of `field_type`.
- The build badge link apparently requires a branch to be specified now.

## Other Changes

There are other changes in the Getty 0.2.2 release. You can see the full changelog [here](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/compare/0.2.1...0.2.2).
