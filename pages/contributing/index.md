# Contributing

Contributions to Getty are very welcome! This document provides some guidelines
and information to help get you started.

## Zig

- Until Zig reaches 1.0, Getty tracks the `master` release of Zig.

## Issues

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getty-zig/getty/issues) are used
  exclusively for tracking bugs and feature requests for Getty.

- When filing a feature request, please check if the latest version of Getty
  already implements the feature beforehand and whether there's already an
  issue filed for your feature.

- When filing an issue, please specify the version of Getty and the operating
  system you are experiencing the issue with, and an explanation of how to
  reproduce your issue.

## Pull Requests


- Please follow our [Coding Style](/coding-style) whenever contributing code.

- When submitting a PR, please have it be relative to a very recent Git tip.

- Before submitting a PR, please test your changes and ensure that the test suite passes locally.

- To update the code in an existing PR, please force-push into the same branch,
  overriding old commits with new ones.

- After pushing a new version of a PR, please add a comment about the new
  version. Notifications aren't sent for commits, so it's easy to miss updates
  without an explicit comment.

If I'm not able to get to your issue or PR right away, I apologize in advance. I'm trying my best though!
