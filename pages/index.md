Getty is a framework for building __robust__, __optimal__, and __reusable__ (de)serializers in Zig.

Getty provides out-of-the-box support for a variety of standard library types,
enables _local_ customization of (de)serialization logic for both existing
and remote types, and maintains its own data model abstractions that serve as
simple and generic baselines from which serializers and deserializers can
operate.
