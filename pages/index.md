Getty is a framework for building __robust__, __optimal__, and __reusable__ (de)serializers in Zig.

## Goals

- Minimize the amount of code required for (de)serializer implementations.
- Enable granular customization of the (de)serialization process.
- Avoid as much performance overhead as possible.

## Features

- Compile-time (de)serialization.
- Out-of-the-box support for a variety of `std` types.
- Local customization of (de)serialization logic for both existing and remote types.
- Data model abstractions that serve as simple and generic baselines for (de)serializers.
